# Lewis

A small card for displaying my info in npm

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have node and npm v5.0.0 or higher installed.

```
npm -v
```

## Usage

```bash
npx @lewismunyi/card
```
Not including how to use it globally because I'm not sure why you'd want this as a global command. That'd be creepy.
